# üè¶ Decentralized Savings Account

## Project Title
**Simple Savings Account Smart Contract with Compound Interest**

## Project Description
The Decentralized Savings Account is a blockchain-based financial application built on Ethereum that allows users to deposit ETH and earn compound interest over time. This smart contract eliminates the need for traditional banking intermediaries by providing a trustless, transparent, and automated savings solution.

Users can deposit their ETH into the contract and watch their balance grow through compound interest calculations. The contract automatically calculates and applies interest based on the time elapsed since the last update, ensuring fair and accurate returns for all participants.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize access to savings and investment opportunities through blockchain technology. We aim to:

- **Financial Inclusion**: Provide savings opportunities to anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency
- **Transparency**: Offer complete visibility into interest calculations and contract operations
- **Decentralization**: Remove dependence on traditional banking systems and intermediaries
- **Accessibility**: Create a simple, user-friendly platform that requires no complex financial knowledge
- **Innovation**: Pioneer the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) savings solutions
